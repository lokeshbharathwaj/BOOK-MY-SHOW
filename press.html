    What is JustWatch?
</h3>
<p>
    JustWatch is a new streaming search engine - to help you find out where to watch movies legally. What’s new on Netflix, Hulu or iTunes? Where to watch this movie you’ve been talking about? On JustWatch you can find all that in one app. To make the experience even more worthwhile, you can customize your individual settings and use easy and intuitive filters for providers like Google Play and Amazon Prime, many different genres or release year.

Our goal is to connect movie fans with their favourite content worldwide.

JustWatch is starting out as a webapp optimized for tablets and smartphones. However, it works also on laptops and computers. For users, this service is completely free.

Our business model is to help movie studios advertise to the right audience. Therefore we are building a fully integrated adtech stack to be able to target those fans. Our goal is to make movie marketing a lot more efficient for advertisers and a lot less annoying and more valuable for users.

    "JustWatch Debuts A New Search Engine For Cord Cutters"
Sarah Perez, Techcrunch
</p>
<p>
    "The easiest way to tell which streaming service has the show you want."
David Nield, Gizmodo
</p>
<p>
    "The problem with cord cutting is that it can often be difficult to find what you’re looking for on all of these streaming services. Thankfully, one nifty web app is looking to simplify the searching process."
Zach Epstein, BGR
</p>
<p>
    "There are several other similar services for finding what's streaming online but JustWatch is probably the best I've found."
